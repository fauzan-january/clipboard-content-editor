summary = "Clipboard Content Editor"
description = """Edits the current clipboard text in a simple editor so pasted content reflects the changes. Shortcuts: NVDA+E opens the editor, NVDA+Z restores the previous clipboard, and NVDA+I shows clipboard info."""
changelog = """- Added **Save As** feature (Ctrl+Shift+S) to the editor, allowing content to be saved as .txt or other file types.
- Added a setting to enable or disable addon sounds.
- Added comprehensive sound feedback to Information, Restore Backup, and Replace All features for consistent audio cues.
- Fixed the "Read in [Language]" links in the documentation to correctly open the HTML files instead of showing file not found errors or opening raw source files.
- The editor buttons are now strictly ordered for better navigation: Information -> Find -> Replace -> Save -> Save As -> Cancel."""
